Repo for macros to analyze MC::Lund banks from CLAS12 Hipo files
## MCLundAnalysis.C
1. This macro is currently under construction  
1. The end goal of this macro is to take in hipo files, read the MC::Lund banks, and then store the data in a TTree
2. Later, I hope to add more files to run loads of hipo files at once through slurm processes.
