Files with "product" in their name were calculated with the 'calculate_product' flag set to True
This means that the product of the affinity was taken between the first pion's affinity and second pion's affinity (using each pions momenta for their respective R1)

Files with "dihadron" in their name were calculated with 'the calculate_product' flag set false - these are calculated using the dihadron's Ph for the R1 calculation

Files with "ONEPION" in their name were calculated with the product flag on, but the code was adjusted so that only p1's Affinity was used, and no product was calculated
